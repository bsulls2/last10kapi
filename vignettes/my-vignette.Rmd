# API link and description

Financial statements are output into data frames and from there are
easy to manipulate and use in further analyses. A full suite of 
financial ratios are also viewable for a given ticker. But as the
variety and availability of these may vary by company, ratios are
output into a list and can then be manipulated into a data frame
depending on which ratios are desired.

# Function details
    
#### Names
* `cash_flows_data`
* `balance_sheet_data`
* `income_statement_data`
* `equity_data`
* `fin_ratios`
* `historical_stock_prices`

#### Example
* Each function references an endpoint in the following format with parameters specified by the user https://services.last10k.com/v1/company/{ticker}/balancesheet[?formType][&filingOrder].
* In this case we will use GE, 10-K, and 0 in the function balance_sheet_data: https://services.last10k.com/v1/company/GE/balancesheet?formType=10-K&filingOrder=0. Note that all function parameters must be entered in parentheses.
    + `ticker` = GE
    + `formType` - Annual (value = 10-K) or Quarterly (value = 10-Q)
    + `filingOrder` - retrieve an older financial statement by specifying the number of filings to go back, starting with the most recent filing (value = 0). For example to get the filing before the most recent filing, specify a filingOrder number of 1. By default the most recent filing is returned (filingOrder = 0). 
    + `balance_sheet_data("GE", "10-K", "0", "your_api_key")` returns a data frame of GE's most recent 10-K balance sheet. 
    + `balance_sheet_full("GE", "10-K", "0", "your_api_key")` returns all of GE's balance sheet content verbatim from their most recent 10-K.
